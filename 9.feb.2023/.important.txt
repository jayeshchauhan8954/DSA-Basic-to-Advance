//notes for Anagram

let's have two string 
first word may be => "word"
second word may be => "drow"
Now check both have equal numbers of character and should have same characters
Thus, it means these two words are "Anagram". Also, the arrangment of those words may be different.
=====PROPERTIES=====
1. they should have same lenth
2. the frequency of the every character in each string should be same

let us consider an example
took a word "eclectic"
frequency=>
e - 2
c - 3
l - 1
t - 1
i - 1
now took another word "ctilcece"
frequency=>
c - 3
t - 1
i - 1
l - 1
e - 2
So we can say that, these two above words are Anagrams.

// notes for first non reapeating character

let the word => "character"
first find frequency of character
frequency=>
c - 2
h - 1
a - 2
r - 2
t - 1
e - 1
thus the first non repeating character is "h"
